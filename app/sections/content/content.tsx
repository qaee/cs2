                    I'm currently designing and building a job board website.

                    I've started designing the page which shows a full job description posting once the user clicks through from a list of search results.

                    The one problem I'm facing is that the actual content just looks completely dull.

                    Its essentially just a text document with a set of sub-headings, copy and a couple of lists here and there.

                    What methods can I use to layout or style this kind of thing to make it look interesting, readable and not just seem like a dull word document whilst maintaining a professional look?

            </Grid>
